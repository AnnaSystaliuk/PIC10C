## This project is a Grade Calculator.

I designed and implemented Qt Graphical User Interface (GUI for short) that computes the grade of a student given a set of homework and exam scores for PIC 10B and 10C. I tried to make user interface similar to what we did in class. A picture of application running is at the bottom.
