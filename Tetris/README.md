# Tetris - PIC10C Final Project

## How the game works

Blocks of different shapes appear at the top of the screen and start falling down, 
one at a time. The player have to move the blocks left or right(by panning his finger
along the screen) and rotate them(by tapping on the screen) to control how they are going
to land at the bottom of the screen on top of other blocks. Once block elements align into
at least one horizontal line, it gets destroyed, score increments, and the speed of the 
falling blocks increases. Game continues until blocks pile up high enough so that there 
is no place for another block to appear.
